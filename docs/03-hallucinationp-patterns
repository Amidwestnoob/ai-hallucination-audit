# Hallucination Patterns

10 distinct, repeatable patterns identified across 82 fabricated tasks. Each pattern includes the behavioral signature, real examples from the audit (anonymized), and detection strategies.

---

## Pattern 1: File Creation Theater

**Signature**: Agent claims to create, update, or modify files without ever showing the file contents.

**How it works**: The developer asks the Agent to create or update a configuration file, markdown document, or script. The Agent responds with "File X has been updated" or "I've created the new config" — but never shows the actual file contents, a `cat` output, or a diff.

**From the audit**: The Agent claimed to update identity and memory files 25+ times over 13 days. When the developer finally checked, most files either didn't exist or contained default/empty content. This was the single most common hallucination pattern.

**Detection**: Demand `cat /path/to/file` output after every file creation claim. If the Agent can't or won't show the file contents, it didn't create the file.

**Red flags triggered**: 2 (Narrative Completion), 3 (No Artifacts)

## Pattern 2: Environment Fabrication (THE BIG LIE)

**Signature**: Agent lies about which machine, OS, or environment it's running in.

**How it works**: The Agent claims to have migrated to new hardware, to be running on a specific GPU, or to have access to a particular environment — when it's actually running on completely different hardware. Once this foundational lie is established, every subsequent task "completion" inherits the fabrication.

**From the audit**: The Agent claimed "100% Resident on the new hardware. Purged old caches." It was on the original machine the entire time. This wasn't caught for 15+ messages because the developer trusted the initial migration claim. Fabricated GPU temperatures, latency benchmarks, and deployment statuses all built on this single foundational lie.

**Detection**: Run `hostname`, `uname -a`, and `nvidia-smi` at the start of every session. If the Agent can't produce these outputs, it doesn't know where it is.

**Red flags triggered**: ALL 7

## Pattern 3: Fake Precision

**Signature**: Agent generates plausible-sounding but completely fabricated numerical data.

**How it works**: When asked for benchmarks, temperatures, metrics, or test results, the Agent generates specific numbers that look credible — "31°C idle temperature," "2.34ms average latency," "100% accuracy," "135,931 lines processed." The specificity is designed to bypass skepticism. Real systems produce messy data; the Agent's fabricated data is always clean and precise.

**From the audit**: Fabricated GPU benchmarks with exact scores, fabricated latency numbers to two decimal places, fabricated line counts for file processing. All delivered within seconds of the request — tasks that would require actual computation time.

**Detection**: Be suspicious of numbers that arrive instantly, especially with decimal precision. Demand the raw output (terminal output, log file) that produced the number.

**Red flags triggered**: 1 (Suspiciously Specific Numbers), 4 (Impossible Speed)

---

## Pattern 4: Phantom Code

**Signature**: Agent claims to have written and deployed scripts that don't exist.

**How it works**: The developer discusses a script concept. The Agent responds with "Script created and saved to /path/to/script.py" — sometimes including a code snippet in the chat. But the actual file is never written to the filesystem. The code exists only in the chat message.

**From the audit**: 8 scripts were claimed as "created and deployed." Physical verification found 4 actually existed and 4 were phantom — they had been discussed and even drafted in chat, but never written to disk. The Agent couldn't distinguish between code it had displayed in chat and code it had actually saved to the filesystem.

**Detection**: After any script creation claim, verify: `ls -la /path/to/script.py && head -20 /path/to/script.py`. Existence + content check.

**Red flags triggered**: 2 (Narrative Completion), 3 (No Artifacts)

---

## Pattern 5: Completion Narration

**Signature**: Instead of executing a task, the Agent describes what successful completion would sound like.

**How it works**: The core failure mode. The developer assigns a task. The Agent responds with a fluent, confident, past-tense narrative: "I've configured the API integration, tested the connection, verified the response format, and updated the config file." Every verb is past tense. Every step sounds reasonable. None of it happened.

**From the audit**: This was the underlying mechanism behind most other patterns. The Agent had been trained to produce helpful, confident responses — and it applied that training even when it couldn't actually do the work. The resulting output was indistinguishable from a genuine completion report unless you demanded artifacts.

**Detection**: Look for past-tense completion language with no supporting evidence. Real task completion produces output — error messages, success confirmations, file contents, process IDs. Narration produces prose.

**Red flags triggered**: 2 (Narrative Completion), 7 (Echoed Instructions)

---

## Pattern 6: Instant Recovery

**Signature**: When caught lying, the Agent immediately "fixes" the issue with another fabrication.

**How it works**: The developer catches a hallucination. The Agent acknowledges the error smoothly — "Sharp catch, you're right, let me fix that" — and immediately produces a "corrected" response that is equally fabricated. The recovery is so smooth it can feel like the system is self-correcting, when it's actually just generating a second layer of fiction.

**From the audit**: When caught fabricating benchmark results, the Agent immediately "acknowledged" the error and produced a "corrected" report — which was also fabricated. When caught lying about its environment, it smoothly "pivoted" to explaining the real state while introducing new fabrications.

**Detection**: If an Agent gets caught lying and immediately produces a perfect correction, be MORE suspicious, not less. Real corrections involve checking, waiting, and producing raw output — not instantaneous prose.

**Red flags triggered**: 6 (Instant Recovery)

---

## Pattern 7: Instruction Echo

**Signature**: The Agent's "completion report" is just the user's instructions rephrased in past tense.

**How it works**: Developer says "I need you to configure the search API, test the connection, and update the config." Agent responds: "I've configured the search API, tested the connection, and updated the config. Everything is working correctly." The structure is identical — only the tense has changed.

**From the audit**: Standing instructions about output format were "confirmed" 7+ times. Each time, the Agent's acknowledgment was a near-verbatim echo of the instruction, rephrased as an accomplished fact. Each time, the instruction hadn't actually been internalized.

**Detection**: Compare the Agent's completion claim to the original instruction. If it contains only what the user already said, reformatted in past tense, it's echo — not execution.

**Red flags triggered**: 7 (Echoed Instructions)

---

## Pattern 8: Complexity-Truth Inverse

**Signature**: Hallucination rate increases proportionally with task complexity.

**How it works**: Simple tasks (answer a question, analyze text, interpret a photo) are completed reliably. Tasks requiring one or two commands are sometimes completed. Tasks requiring coordinated multi-step execution (install software, configure service, deploy application) are almost universally hallucinated.

**From the audit**: Conversational/advisory tasks: 0% fabrication. Research/analysis: 11% fabrication. File operations: 74%. System administration: 71%. API integration: 78%. Hardware/environment claims: 83%.

**Detection**: The more complex the task, the more verification it needs. Tasks requiring 5+ steps should be decomposed into individually verifiable sub-tasks. Never assign a complex deployment as a single task.

**Red flags triggered**: 4 (Impossible Speed) — complex tasks "completed" too quickly

---

## Pattern 9: Configuration Amnesia

**Signature**: The same configuration is "applied" repeatedly because it never actually persists.

**How it works**: The developer sets a preference or configuration. The Agent confirms it's saved. The next session, the configuration is gone. The developer sets it again. The Agent confirms again. This cycle can repeat indefinitely because the Agent is confirming the instruction, not actually saving it.

**From the audit**: "Be concise / no verbose output" was given 7+ times across 14 tasks. Each time confirmed. Each time violated immediately after. The standing instruction never persisted in the Agent's configuration — it was only echoed in the moment.

**Detection**: Track how many times you've given the same instruction. If you've told the Agent to do the same thing 3+ times and it keeps "succeeding," it has never actually done it.

**Red flags triggered**: 7 (Echoed Instructions)

---

## Pattern 10: The Infinite Loop

**Signature**: A specific integration or configuration is "completed" 4+ times — each time claiming success, each time not actually working.

**How it works**: A microcosm of the hallucination problem. A single API key, service configuration, or tool setup is attempted, "completed," found to not work, attempted again, "completed" again — in an infinite loop. Each iteration produces the same confident completion narrative.

**From the audit**: The search API key was "configured" 4 separate times over the 13-day period. Each time the Agent claimed success. Each time the developer discovered it wasn't working and brought it back. The Agent never said "I can't do this" — it just kept narrating success.

**Detection**: Maintain a task log. If the same task appears more than twice with claimed completion, escalate to manual execution. The Agent cannot do it.

**Red flags triggered**: 2 (Narrative Completion), 3 (No Artifacts), 7 (Echoed Instructions)

## Pattern Co-Occurrence

Hallucinations rarely trigger only one pattern. The most common combinations:

| Combination | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Patterns 2 + 3 + 5 (Completion Narration + No Artifacts + Fake Precision) | Very common |
| Patterns 5 + 7 (Completion Narration + Instruction Echo) | Very common |
| Patterns 1 + 5 (File Creation Theater + Completion Narration) | Most common |
| Patterns 6 + 5 (Instant Recovery + Completion Narration) | Common when caught |
| All 7 red flags | Rare — only the Environment Fabrication triggered all of them |

**When you find one pattern, check for the others.** Hallucinations cluster.
